They are super gentle and non-drying on skin, while still being able to clean very well (and are thick and tough enough too to not feel as though your hands are getting yucky while changing icky diapers). ” /*/Amber],[Will never buy another brand again!/*/“I will never buy another brand again! Pampers Pure is seriously the best diapers I've used for my daughter. The biggest perk is that the diapers are perfect for my daughter's sensitive skin. ” /*/Kourtnee],[I love the Pampers Pure Collection!/*/“I am so excited about this new diaper! I feel like I finally don't have to compromise when choosing a diaper any longer! Pampers Pure offers me plant-based and other soft materials and stylish prints!

I only trust the best for my daughter's skin. ” /*/Amanda],[These work great!/*/“I love wipes that I feel confident using not only for diaper changes but for wiping faces and hands. These wipes contain 99% pure water so I feel safe using them on my sensitive skin little ones without worry. Most importantly, they work great! ” /*/Kira],[Absolute favorite! /*/“As a mom of 2 toddlers using great quality products for my children is so important.  The Pampers Pure Diapers are one product that definitely fit the bill. I've tried many other diaper brands and the Pampers Pure Collection is by far one of my absolute favorites! ” /*/Lauren],[I was so excited/*/“I was so excited to hear about Pampers Aqua Pure wipes. 99% is pure water.
